Some research areas addressed by the Lab-STICC/MOCS team at ENSTA Bretagne are:

- Federation-based model-driven system design (*Role4All*)
- Environment-driven critical system verification ([*OBP*](http://www.obpcdl.org/))
- Modular online/offline diagnosis for IoT and critical systems ([*Pluggable-OBP*](https://plug-obp.github.io/))
- Model-based high-level synthesis (*Newage*)
- Reconfigurable SoC architecture modeling & design (*Biniou, Madeo*).

The team has access to a *heterogeneous high-performance cyber-research
platform* enabling industrial-scale quantitative and qualitative experimental studies.
